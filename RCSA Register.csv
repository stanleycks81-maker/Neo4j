"Technology","Loss of Key tech Personnel","Possible","Minor","Medium","To control the risk of losing key tech personnel, the strategy focuses on eliminating single points of failure through preventive measures like mandatory cross-training and a familiarisation of business systems like SINDI, MS 365 Admin, Slack Admin, Crowdstrike, Cisco Network and others. Department also use Bitwarden to shared password vaults. 

If a loss occurs, corrective actions such as re-assignment of task, formal handover process, and engaging third-party sub-contractor and support to fill the gap. These actions are all underpinned by directive policies that mandate documentation, access control, and a formal offboarding process to ensure knowledge is transferred.","Possible","Minor","Medium","Technology – 01 Technology Risk Management Framework

"Technology","[Potential Day 0 attack on End Devices]","Possible","Minor","Medium","Preventive controls aim to reduce the attack surface by enforcing strict network segmentation to protect critical systems like SINDI, applying the principle of least privilege to all accounts. 

Crowdstrike mitigates zero-day attacks by focusing on Indicators of Attack (IOAs) rather than traditional signatures. Its preventive NGAV and behavioral blocking use machine learning to stop malicious processes before they can complete. Its detective EDR capabilities (Falcon Insight) record all endpoint activity, allowing its cloud AI to identify suspicious sequences of events in real-time. Finally, its corrective response automatically isolates a compromised endpoint from the network to stop the attack's spread, while providing security teams with remote access to investigate and remediate the threat.","Possible","Minor","Medium","Technology – 01 Technology Risk Management Framework

"Trading","Market Risk (Trading); Financial loss due to trading. Most of the hedging on PS products (e.g. Penguin Secure) cannot (or impractical) to be 100% back-to-back.
Therefore, basis risks arise and can be in the following forms:
Stablecoin depegging risk; Client subscribes in USD but hedging portfolio value may be locked in USDT/USDC instead (if USDT-denominated futures are used). PS has to make up the shortfall in USD value guaranteed in the client contract if the USDT portfolio depreciates because of a depegging event. 
Futures-implied yield curve/DV01 risk; Maturities of client's contract (payout) typically do not match the expiries of the underlying hedges. In the event that the futures-implied yields for these hedges were to rise relatively to that of the payouts', PS will incur a net loss in its portfolio.","Unlikely","Moderate","Medium","Trading monitors the Asset Breakdown risk dashboards on Sindi daily to ensure that the exposure to non-USD hedges are within risk appetite.

"Trading","Liquidation risk on hedging positions due to idiosyncratic risk in the markets, such as sudden price movements, index manipulation, or
extreme volatility may trigger forced liquidations. An example is when the hedge (futures) spiked in price while the spot BTC asset price does not change, resulting in a margin call and an auto liquidation by the exchange.Replacement cost (to execute the hedge trade) may be costly. If PS fails to replace in time, the cost could be a lot higher in very volatile market.","Unlikely","Major","Medium","As much as possible, hedges are executed on highly liquid contracts such as the H,M,U,Z quarterlies, and on coin-margined futures where the settlement currency matches the BTC asset's.
Although the firm seeks off-exchange settlement, sufficient BTC assets are still kept on the trading venues to reduce the leverage at the exchanges.
