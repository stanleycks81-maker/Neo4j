"Trading","Market Risk (Trading); Financial loss due to trading. Most of the hedging on PS products (e.g. Penguin Secure) cannot (or impractical) to be 100% back-to-back.
Therefore, basis risks arise and can be in the following forms:
Stablecoin depegging risk; Client subscribes in USD but hedging portfolio value may be locked in USDT/USDC instead (if USDT-denominated futures are used). PS has to make up the shortfall in USD value guaranteed in the client contract if the USDT portfolio depreciates because of a depegging event. 
Futures-implied yield curve/DV01 risk; Maturities of client's contract (payout) typically do not match the expiries of the underlying hedges. In the event that the futures-implied yields for these hedges were to rise relatively to that of the payouts', PS will incur a net loss in its portfolio.","Unlikely","Moderate","Medium","Trading monitors the Asset Breakdown risk dashboards on Sindi daily to ensure that the exposure to non-USD hedges are within risk appetite.
The cashflows, as well of the DV01 risk of the trading portfolios are also monitored and tracked via Sindi's risk dashboard by the trading team.","Rare","Moderate","Low","TBD",,"Financial","False","10/16/2025 5:23 AM","6/10/2025 3:02 AM","Stanley Chin"

"Trading","Liquidation risk on hedging positions due to idiosyncratic risk in the markets, such as sudden price movements, index manipulation, or
extreme volatility may trigger forced liquidations. An example is when the hedge (futures) spiked in price while the spot BTC asset price does not change, resulting in a margin call and an auto liquidation by the exchange.Replacement cost (to execute the hedge trade) may be costly. If PS fails to replace in time, the cost could be a lot higher in very volatile market.","Unlikely","Major","Medium","As much as possible, hedges are executed on highly liquid contracts such as the H,M,U,Z quarterlies, and on coin-margined futures where the settlement currency matches the BTC asset's.
Although the firm seeks off-exchange settlement, sufficient BTC assets are still kept on the trading venues to reduce the leverage at the exchanges.
